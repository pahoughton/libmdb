      Describes how to install a specific version of &PRJ.NAME; as a
      support tool for your project. It gives instructions for setting
      up your environement and has a link to a Makefile that can be
      used to setup and install the neccessary files.

	Directory Structure and Environment Variables

      <sectbody>
	<p>
	  The setup and installation process retrieves and installs a
	  number of components needed by &PRJ.NAME;. To accommodate
	  the automated setup and installation, a specific
	  subdirectory structure is required. The root of this
	  subdirectory structure is referenced by the TOOL_DIR
	  environment variable.
	</p>
	<p>
	  You can use any existing directory for TOOL_DIR. I recommend
	  creating a Support directory at the same level as your
	  project's top directory. For example, lets say your project
	  is currently in the directory /Projects/CoolStuff. The first
	  thing you would do is create a 'Devel' directory at the same
	  level as your current project directory, then you would move
	  your project directory into the Devel directory. Now create
	  a Support directory at the same level as your project
	  directory. This new 'Support' directory will be used for all
	  the external support tools and libraries your project needs.
      </p>
      <p>
	Here are the commands you would need to execute:
      </p>
      <p>
	<indent>
	  <code>
	    cd /Projects<br/>
	    mkdir Devel<br/>
	    mv CoolStuff Devel<br/>
	    cd Devel
	    mkdir Support
	    export TOOL_DIR=/Projects/Devel/Support<br/>
	    PATH=$TOOL_DIR/bin:$PATH<br/>
	    MANPATH=$TOOL_DIR/man:$MANPATH<br/>
	  </code>
	</indent>
      </p>
      <p>
	You should update your ~/.profile to include the settings of the
	TOOL_DIR, PATH and MANPATH environment variables.

	Creating a Project with
	<subdir dir="&MAKE.CONFIGS;">MakeConfigs</subdir>
	<doc doc="&MAKE.CONFIGS;/User/GenProject">GenProject</doc>
      </heading>
      <sectbody>
	<p>
	  The best way to automatically setup &PRJ.NAME; with your
	  project is to use
	  <doc doc="&MAKE.CONFIGS;/User/GenProject">GenProject</doc>
	  which will create a
	  project directory structure with Makefiles and other common
	  project files. There is one small issue though, you have to
	  have MakeConfigs installed before you can run GenProject to
	  setup your project for you. If MakeConfigs is already
	  installed on the system you will be using for development,
	  just run GenProject according to its documentation. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  If MakeConfigs is not installed, first setup your directories
	  and environment as described above in
	  <xref ref="DirEnv" term="DirEnv" />. Then follow the instructions in
	  the Standalone Installation instructions of MakeConfigs
	  starting at
	  <doc doc="&MAKE.CONFIGS;/User/StandaloneInstall"
	       ref="Retrieve">
	    Retrieving MakeConfigs
	  </doc>.
	  Once this is complete, you can run GenProject to create you
	  project directories and files.

	<p>
	  If you used GenProject or have a MakeConfigs Support.Makefile
	  under your project's 'support' directory, added the contents of this
	  <ulink url="Support.Makefile.txt">Support.Makefile</ulink>
	  to your Support.Makefile

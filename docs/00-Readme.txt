Howdy, I suppose your looking for some documentation?

The documentation for the classes in this library is split into three
primary parts. They are:

    General Library Documentation:

	libMdb/docs/00-Readme.txt:	this file.
	libMdb/docs/Description.txt:	general library description.
	libMdb/docs/Classes.txt:	short description of each class.
	
    Class Usage Documentation

	This is found in the header file (i.e. libMdb/src/Class.hh)
	for each class just below the class definition

    Design Documentation:

	This is found in libMdb/docs/design/.

There is also example source code for the classes in the
'libMdb/example' directory. This source should help you get a feel for
how to use the classes in your application.
